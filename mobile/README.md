* [react-native-toast-message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-toast-message) is used for toast notifications.
* [react-native-async-storage/async-storage](https://react-native-async-storage.github.io/async-storage/) is used for storing security token, received from the backend, in a persistent way (so it doesn't reset in case app reloads).
* [react-native-dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-dotenv) is used for storing configuration values in the `.env` files.
* [react-ridge-state](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-ridge-state) is used for extremely simple and granular state management (as we don't have big project, but one variable should be global).
